        <h2 class="decal-subheader">About this Course</h2>
        <p class="description">When we mystify songwriting (the “muse” was talking to me), creators have a wonderful excuse for why their songs are terrible. More importantly, when performing live and people tune out or divert their attention, some blame it out on the crowd instead of the songs. Intro to Songwriting explores how to make songs more expressive (fairly hard) and keep your listener’s attention throughout 3-4 minutes (hardest). This is a course engineered for both musicians and non-musicians to explore the craft of songwriting.</p>
        <h2 class="decal-subheader">Goals for the Course</h2>
        <ul class="listy">
          <li>Know the basics of Music Theory (Diatonic Harmony)</li>
          <li>Recognize compositional elements that accentuate the theme of the song</li>
          <li>Indentify typical song structures and construct your own within and outside these forms</li>
          <li>Learn the Basics of a DAW to present your ideas clearly</li>
          <li>Begin writing lyrics with your own voice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="decal-subheader">Who You Are (Am I a good fit?)</h2>
        <p class="description">Everyone has something they can be better at; we're taking all skill-levels and I think that's cooler! We hope that you are curious about songwriting either the lyrics or the music, and want to write your own songs. Maybe you’ve been writing your “own stuff”, you’re shy about performing, or you need a little help knowing where to begin. You don’t need to be a formally trained musician, but you must play some instrument (voice even if you don’t sing well, counts as an instrument. If you foresee this being an issue, come talk to us and we might be able to work something out ...). Everyone has a wide variety of talent, it may be that some have a way with words, others with constructing melodies, and some creating infectious rhythms. You are willing to step out of your comfort zone, try things to find where your specialty is, and fake confidence when collaborating with others, so that others can help you become strong where you are weak. </p>
        <h2 class="decal-subheader" id="Grading">Grading</h2>
        <p class="description">In order to earn a ‘P’ is in this course, you will need to attend class. We will also have workshops/office hours/jam sessions after class; you will be required to attend 3 of those. All students will have 1 unexcused absence – no questions asked. In addition, there will be 2 performances worth 10% each (graded on a completion basis).</p>
        <ul class="listy">
          <li>Participation: 50% (Attend 14 classes, 3 workshops)</li>
          <li>Homework: 30% (Song Submission)</li>
          <li>Performances: 20% (Perform twice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">To clarify, attending each class/workshop will earn you 2.94% (50/17); Anything above 70% is an automatic pass; in addition, this class will be curved so that I can help the students within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Basically, it will be extremely difficult to fail this class, but don’t take that as a challenge. </p>
        <h2 class="decal-subheader">Required Texts</h2>
        <ul class="listy">
          <li>Writing Better Lyrics – Pat Pattison (Professor from Berklee)</li>
          <li>War of Art - Steven Pressfield (a must-read for creative people of any field)</li>
